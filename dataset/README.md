# COVID-19 Datasets

There are 10 different countries being considered in the project. Those countries were selected since they have the highest number of confirmed cases on the last observed date, i.e. 8 October 2020.

All the data are taken from *JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data*. https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
